**SolitaryFlower** *Level 1 Fight*  
  
**Countdown** 4  
**Alarm** Hazards! Spawns random element from the ??? table. *(Its probably a good idea to base this off the difficulty level. Either roll an additional element for each difficulty level or increase how far it spreads or mention that its tougher than Normal. Maybe make it weaker if its a lower difficulty and it seems right. Such as making it Easy or single target.)*
